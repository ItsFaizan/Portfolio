           <h3>Current Life</h3>
           <p>I am Faizan Javed. A student of Software
            engineering at <strong>Fast NUCES</strong>. I have
            recently completed my 5 semesters. I am
            a dependable person who is great at time
            management, I am always energetic and
            eager to learn new skills. Being a <strong>software engineering</strong> student, I
            have worked on multiple projects from
            making management systems to website
            development. I have put in my best
            efforts to get the desired results. The day you stopped trying will be your actual failure. In these years, I have gone through many times where I thought that I wouldn't be able to do this task or project but with continuous efforts Alhumduliah I was able to do most of my tasks. Being a student of Fast I have learned how to deal with pressure and how to complete my work on time.</p>

           <h3>Past History</h3>
           <p><strong>Success</strong> is all about trying, you keep trying and ultimately you will achieve <strong>success</strong> one day. The day you stopped trying will be your actual failure. Being a software engineering student I could associate myself with the above lines. In these years, I have gone through many times where I thought that I wouldn't be able to do this task or project but with continuous efforts Alhumduliah I was able to do most of my tasks. Being a student of Fast I have learned how to deal with pressure and how to complete my work on time. Fast has provided me the best opportunities to polish my skills, be it coding or communication with others. But in all these things one thing was constant, the continuous efforts I put in to gain these skills. While coding I was stuck in errors but I kept on trying and eventually getting a solution most of the times. Even in my free time I try to learn different skills so that they can help me in my future.</p>
